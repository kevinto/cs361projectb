How to run HTML unit tests:
1. Install PhpUnit at: "https://phpunit.de/getting-started.html". Do not try to install it on the flip server. You do not have root access. Instead just directly run the executable.

2. Get the HTML Validator module at "https://404it.no/en/blog/php_class_for_validating_html5". Put it into the same folder your PhpUnit executable.

3. CD into the folder containing the phpUnit test executable. In this case, it is the root folder of our PHP webapp. In the flip terminal type: "php phpunit.phar volunteertest.php"
